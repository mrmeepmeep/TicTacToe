# TicTacToe
A TicTacToe project


Make a Gameboard object with an array inside it that stores the gameboard.
Players are also going to be stored in the object.
And i want a object that controls the flow of the game itself.

1. Try it with as little global code as possible (try tucking in Factory functions.)

2. Think carefully about where each bit of logic should be stored.

3. Include logic that checks if the game is over, Checking for all 3 in a rows and ties. Avoid thinking about the DOM and HTML/CSS until the game is working.

4. Once you have a working console game, create an object that will handle the display with the appropriate DOM elements. Write a function that wil render the contents of the gameboard arrays to the webpage for now. You can always just fill the gameboard array with "X" and "O"s 

5. Write the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board by  interacting with the appropriate DOM elements.(letting players click on a square to place their markers.) Dont forget the lohic that keeps players from playing from playing in spots that are already taken.

6. Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that shows the results upon game end.
